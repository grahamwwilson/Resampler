1. Reference MINUIT fit.

Use reweightfitg-0-0-Alt1.out
as the reference fit to Run5 symmetric data. 
This is with the 10 parameter fit, using "10m/testbc-1-0.dat" as the RW file.

  Notice dmu1 is 0.0117e-3 = +11.7 +- 8.6 ppm
         dmu2 is             +23.6 +- 7.2 ppm   
Hmm - maybe we should only fit with dmu1=dmu2? 
These appear consistent and there seems no reason in our current model 
for them to be different.
  
2. KS Tests.
A) Of 10M event model with Run5.
   /home/graham/BeamSpectrumGenerator/10m/testbcg-3-4.cdat   
   
Unbinned classic 2-sample KS Test of 1-d ECM distribution
Sample sizes:                171349 10000000
Effective number of points:  168462
KS Test results. Dobs:       0.00250032
Pure z:                      1.02624
Stephens T*:                 1.02654

Unbinned classic 2-sample KS Test of 1-d Ediff distribution 
Sample sizes:                171349 10000000
Effective number of points:  168462
KS Test results. Dobs:       0.00210662
Pure z:                      0.864646
Stephens T*:                 0.864899
Asymptotic p-value           0.443346
Finite approximation p-value 0.442971

Conclusion: At the 1-d distribution level the ECM and pz distributions 
are perfectly well described by the fitted model as evidenced by 
the KS test p-values being acceptable.
This test could have been done more powerfully using the 1-sample test 
(necessitating some integrals). However the factor of 58 more MC statistics than 
data mean that the dilution of power due to MC statistics implicit in the two-sample test 
compared to the one-sample test (Neff=168462 instead of Neff=171349) is of 
no significant concern.

One significant caveat is that the calculated KS test significance levels 
are not to be trusted in our case where we have estimated parameters 
with the same data. Nevertheless it is very reassuring that the two main 1-d physics 
distributions are modelled very well in our case.
Maybe the solution is to try fitting an independent "data-set" from Guinea-PIG?

B) Of GP Run5 with GP Run 7.

Unbinned classic 2-sample KS Test of 1-d ECM distribution 
Sample sizes:                156231 171349
Effective number of points:  81720.6
KS Test results. Dobs:       0.00244745
Pure z:                      0.699649
Stephens T*:                 0.699944
Asymptotic p-value           0.711819
Finite approximation p-value 0.711329
 
Unbinned classic 2-sample KS Test of 1-d Ediff distribution 
Sample sizes:                156231 171349
Effective number of points:  81720.6
KS Test results. Dobs:       0.00346617
Pure z:                      0.990868
Stephens T*:                 0.991286
Asymptotic p-value           0.279917
Finite approximation p-value 0.279458

So at this level - these GP data-sets are statistically consistent with each other. 
Note that the two GP runs do share statistically identical beam input files.

C) GP Run7 compared with 10M event model 3 (was fitted to GP Run 5).

Looks good!
